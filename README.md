# JSON Navigator


I made this project with a partner for a school project.

### About




Description: This JSON file navigator is specific to a set of json data that includes students health statistics in the class over a week time period. The
program allows you to navigate through the different information (statistics include such categories: sleep, sugar, phone, fruit, vegetables, caffeine,
strength, moderate intensity exercise, high intensity exercise and steps). You may navigate through the information as well as perform multiple functions
including, checking if a particular student is healthy, comparing two students statistics, printing a particular students stats, printing the average +
maximum + minimum + range of a students statistics, and finally printing a stastical analysis including standard deviation and variance.

Instructions:
- Follow the prompts in the console to navigate through the JSON data.

### Playing The Game
